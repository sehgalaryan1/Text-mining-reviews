Upon arriving I checked in and had my temperature taken and then was able to ask a few more specific questions to my piercer. We discussed my eligibility based on my anatomy and selected the jewelry before getting started. During the process he explained everything he was doing, which I greatly appreciated. He was very experienced and also took time to build a personal connection and make me feel safe and comfortable. He pierced quickly and efficiently and involved me in the entire process. His warm, open personality really made it a great experience. This is the only place I'll be getting pierced from now on.\n"

I am not much of a player here but even then, it was easy to score a free room a few days away. The bell boy who brought up a mountain of luggage was super helpful and scored extra water bottles and blankets for us (by the way, they do not give out extra comforters, just blankets). \n",

There was a $25 resort fee which we were fine with paying as there were 4 of us using wifi devices and my niece had a blast in the pool downstairs. Not bad considering the room was free.\n",
