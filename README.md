# Text-mining-reviews

This project focuses on analyzing 5 gigabytes of Yelp text data using various machine learning techniques, including sentiment analysis, to categorize reviews into relevant groups. Python functions were developed to present users with the most relevant review for a selected business based on their preferences. By fine-tuning text preprocessing parameters, the performance of these functions was significantly improved, resulting in more accurate and personalized review recommendations.
